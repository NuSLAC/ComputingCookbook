# Getting started

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and tutorials to get you up to speed on research in the experimental neutrino physics group at SLAC!

If you are not familiar yet with Jupyter, Python, Numpy, or PyTorch, please take a look at the [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites/README.md).

Here is a brief introduction about [our physics research](./Physics/README.md).

If you are interested in machine-learning based data reconstruction projects, we have a [separate introduction page](http://deeplearnphysics.org/lartpc_mlreco3d_tutorials).

Work in progress. Feedback welcome!
