# Physics: overview

Our research focus is an application of machine learning techniques to analyze image of _neutrinos_ recorded using a particle imaging detector technology called _LArTPC_. OK, what on the earth does this mean? What are we actually looking for? Neutrinos? That sounds cute, but what is this all about exactly?

1. [Particle Physics](ParticlePhysics.md) ... the sub-field of physics our research belongs to.
2. [Neutrinos](Neutrinos.md) ... ghost particles we hunt everyday.
3. [Neutrino Oscillations](Oscillation.md) ... ghosts oscillate into one another
4. [Detecting neutrinos](DetectingNeutrinos.md) ... how to hunt the ghost.
